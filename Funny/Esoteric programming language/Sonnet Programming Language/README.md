# Sonnet Programming Language (SPL)

The core concept: a valid program must be exactly one Shakespearean sonnet — 14 lines, following the classic structure (3 quatrains + 1 couplet), iambic pentameter as closely as possible, and the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.

The language is deliberately complex and obfuscated: instructions are hidden in poetic vocabulary, syntax, rhyme positions, and meter. Writing even simple programs feels like composing genuine Elizabethan poetry.
