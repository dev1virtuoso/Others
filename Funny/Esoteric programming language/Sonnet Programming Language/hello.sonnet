Shall I proclaim thee fair and full of grace?
Thou art more sweet than summer's golden day.
Thy beauty grows with every passing hour,
More lovely still than roses in their May.
Let love be doubled, heart be twice as true,
Let time stand still when gazing upon thee.
Thy eye doth shine like heaven's brightest star,
Eternal youth shall ever dwell in thee.
But death shall never claim thy living soul,
Nor fade the lines that keep thy memory.
Let breath and voice together now proclaim,
The sum of beauty, love, and joy in thee.
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
  So lives thy name: HELLO eternally.
