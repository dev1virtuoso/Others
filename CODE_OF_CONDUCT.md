As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all individuals who participate through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, and any other activities.

We are committed to creating a positive and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me through [following methods](https://github.com/dev1virtuoso/Documentation/blob/main/dev1virtuoso/Attachment/dev1virtuoso/carson-wu.md). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
